## Background

Forensic chemistry is essential for the scientific analysis of evidence in criminal investigations. Traditional spot tests rely on expert interpretation of color changes, which can be subjective and error-prone. Chemical-AI addresses these challenges by using AI to automate and standardize color prediction, making forensic analysis more reliable and accessible.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The user selects or enters the names of the chemical reagent and analyte.
2. **Processing**: The AI model processes this input, referencing a trained dataset of known reactions and their observed colors.
3. **Output**: The predicted color outcome is displayed to the user, along with confidence scores where applicable.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/5h1Vm/chemical-ai.git
   cd chemical-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
- Enter/select the reagent and analyte.
- Click "Predict" to view the expected color result.

---

## Dataset

The model is trained on a curated dataset of forensic spot tests, including:
- Chemical names (reagent, analyte)
- Observed color outcomes

You can extend the dataset by adding new entries to `data/dataset.csv` and retraining the model.

---

## Model Architecture

- **Input Encoding**: Chemical names are tokenized and embedded.
- **Model**: A machine learning classifier (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Network) predicts the color outcome based on input features.
- **Output**: Color label (e.g., 'blue', 'green', 'brown') and optional confidence score.

Model retraining scripts are provided in the `model/` directory.

## Web Application

The web interface is built using Flask, providing:
- Simple forms for input
- Real-time prediction display
- Easy integration with backend model
